Brief Reflection on CSS Features and Design Choices:

The design employs contemporary CSS methodologies to achieve a structured and responsive interface. CSS Grid and Flexbox provide a robust layout system that adapts effectively across varying screen dimensions. Visual enhancements such as transitions, box-shadows, and hover states contribute to improved user engagement and perceived depth. The typographic hierarchy, color palette, and spacing choices support readability and aesthetic consistency. Additionally, the integration of animation effects, including flipping and fade-ins, enriches interactivity while maintaining usability. Overall, the CSS decisions reflect a balance between functionality, visual appeal, and coherent user experience design.
